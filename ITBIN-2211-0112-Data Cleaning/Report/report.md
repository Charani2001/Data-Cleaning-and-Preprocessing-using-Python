Data Cleaning Report: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

Executive Summary

The Hotel Booking Demand dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. The primary objective of this data cleaning task was to prepare the dataset for accurate analysis and predictive modeling by addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data.

Key Findings and Actions Taken:

- Significant missing data was found in the agent, company, and children columns.
- Duplicates and invalid entries (e.g., zero adults with a booking) were detected.
- Data types were converted appropriately (e.g., date fields).
- New columns (e.g., total_guests) were derived to enhance analysis.

Data Quality Assessment

Original Dataset Characteristics:
- Rows: ~119,390
- Columns: 32
- Included a variety of data types: numeric, categorical, and date/time.

Identified Issues:
Issue	                                        Severity
Missing values in agent & company	            Medium
Zero guests       	                            High
Invalid or unknown entries in country	        Medium
Duplicate rows	                                Low
Inconsistent data types            	            Medium

Cleaning Methodology

- Remove Invalid Bookings:
Removed rows where adults + children + babies == 0.

- Handle Missing Values:
children: Filled with 0 if missing.
agent and company: Filled with 0 and cast to int.
country: Filled with mode ('PRT').

- Data Type Conversion:
Converted reservation_status_date to datetime.
Other categorical variables were left as object or converted to category as appropriate.

- Feature Engineering:
Created a new total_guests column = adults + children + babies.
Optionally, created is_family based on guest count.

- Duplicates:
Dropped 319 duplicate rows.

Results and Impact

Before Cleaning: 
- ~119,390 rows
- Inconsistencies in data types
- Several missing/invalid values
- Redundant or unusable data

After Cleaning:
- ~119,210 rows
- All missing values handled
- No invalid bookings
- Data ready for modeling and EDA

Improvements Achieved:
- Increased reliability and consistency
- Reduced noise and improved data quality
- Enhanced usability for ML or statistical analysis

Recommendations

Improve Data Collection Process:
- Validate input fields
- Ensure mandatory fields (like country) are filled during data entry.

Ongoing Data Maintenance:
- Regularly check for duplicates or outliers.
- Monitor missing data trends for key fields.
- Implement logging for future missing value causes.
